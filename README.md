# Taxi-Fare-Finder-Pro
This project builds a machine learning model to predict taxi fare amounts based on trip information like pickup and drop-off coordinates, passenger count, and datetime features. It is part of the "Taxi Fare Guru: Total Amount Prediction Challenge" on Kaggle.

#  Taxi Fare Finder Pro: A Predictive Analytics Project

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis focused on predicting taxi fare amounts based on ride-specific parameters. The objective is to build an efficient fare prediction model that can be integrated into ride-hailing platforms to ensure pricing transparency, enhance customer satisfaction, and support operational optimization.

## Analysis Focus

Data Cleaning & Outlier Handling  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Distance Calculation using Haversine Formula  
Feature Engineering (hour of day, ride distance, etc.)  
Model Training with Multiple Regressors  
Model Evaluation using standard performance metrics

---

## Key Insights

Fare amounts are significantly influenced by trip distance and time of day  
Short-distance trips during peak hours show increased fare variability  
Optimal performance achieved with **Random Forest Regressor** (low RMSE, high R²)  
Important features: trip distance, pickup hour, and day of the week

---

## Recommendations

Integrate real-time pricing estimator for customer transparency  
Implement dynamic pricing based on traffic, distance, and demand  
Use predictive model to flag potentially anomalous or fraudulent fares  
Enhance user experience by showing estimated fare ranges before booking

---

## Outcome

**Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor  
**RMSE**: ~2.15 (on test set)  
**R² Score**: ~0.89  
Built a reliable model for estimating taxi fares in real-world scenarios
