# Taxi-Fare-Finder-Pro
This project builds a machine learning model to predict taxi fare amounts based on trip information like pickup and drop-off coordinates, passenger count, and datetime features. It is part of the "Taxi Fare Guru: Total Amount Prediction Challenge" on Kaggle.
 Taxi Fare Finder Pro: Total Amount Prediction
This project builds a predictive model to estimate the total fare of taxi rides using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains features such as trip distance, passenger count, pickup and drop-off locations, and more. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the fare amount based on these features.

 Features and Highlights
Data Loading & Cleaning: Read and preprocess raw data for outliers and missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data distributions, correlations, and visualize key relationships.

Feature Engineering: Extract and transform relevant features such as distance, time of day, etc.

Modeling:

Multiple regression models trained and evaluated

Performance metrics computed (e.g., RMSE, RÂ² score)

Model Evaluation: Compare different models and visualize predictions versus actual fares.

 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor

Possibly others (based on code content)
